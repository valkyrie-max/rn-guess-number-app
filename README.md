# Guess a number!

## What is this project about?

This is a project used to improve my knowledge of JS, React and React Native. 
For the past couple of weeks I've been following [this amazing course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide) as well as [official docs](https://reactnative.dev/) to learn React Native. 

In summary, Guess a Number is a mobile application where the user inputs a number and the machine tries to guess it based on user's hints. Sounds a bit silly but it's great React and RN practice! :v: 

**Please keep in mind that this project is still WIP!**

## Install, Run and Use 

Since this is a tiny project, it will never make it to AppStore or to Google Play but you can still can have fun with it! 
If you are interested in messing around with the app, please do the following: 


1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you don't have it on your machine
2. Install [Expo](https://expo.io/learn) if you don't have it by doing this: ```npm install expo-cli --global```
3. Clone this repo
4. Run ```npm install``` or ```yarn install```
5. Then, just do ```npm start``` 

**However, this will not create a simulation**, this process will create a Metro Bundler. In order to see how it runs on phones you can:
1. Run it in an [Android Simulator](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. Run it in an [iOS simulator](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (AVAILABLE ONLY ON iOS SYSTEM)
3. Run it on your own device (Android or iOS) by scanning the QR code or opening it in the Expo mobile app
